## HOW TO USE THE WEBSITE

The simplest way is to click the [TECHZETTE LINK](https://pure-caverns-55570.herokuapp.com/) and begin the fun. 

Or if you would rather go the coder route you can always clone the code yourself,

1. run ```npm i ``` to download all related libraries/packages, 
2. run ``` mysql -u root -p``` to initialize mySQL
3. run ```source db/schema.sql``` that will create a new blog_db database which will prepare you for the next step.
4. Seeding. For this the command is simple ```npm run seeds``` this will add hardcoded data of fake users,posts and even comments
5. run ```npm start``` to start the server and navigate to localhost:3001 in order to view the page with it's seeded contents. 

Have fun with the app!!!
